# Application Name

**Tier:** 2

Create an application that collects data from Google Forms directly in realtime and display the changes in realtime and display it a simple website.

The realtime form data would be transmitted to the backend service via a POST HTTP request, with the help of Triggers in Google App Script.

Then data transmission between your backend service and frontend service would ideally happen via a websocket.


## User Stories

-   [ ] User can start or stop data transmission
-   [ ] User can ... fourth user story

-   etc...

## Bonus features
